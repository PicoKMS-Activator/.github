## How to use the Activator?
The activator does not require users to have special knowledge or skills in configuring settings. Simply download KMSpico Activator, run it, and forget about it. The application will work autonomously.

The program is downloaded in an archive that needs to be unpacked. Next, run the installer file as an administrator and click the button to agree to the next step, including if a request appears on behalf of UAC.

After launching, select the target program for activation, press the large red button, and wait a moment while the software completes the license acquisition process.

Restart your computer. The System Properties window will display information that Windows has been successfully activated. Office will display a similar message. Please note that the software activates the license for a specific period and automatically creates a task in Task Scheduler for automatic renewal. Therefore, you cannot make changes to Task Scheduler, disable it, or delete it.

## Solving problems with KMSPico
In this section, we will look at several common problems related to KMS Pico and suggest possible solutions.

### Problem #1: Windows or Microsoft Office is not activated. What should I do?
If your operating system or office suite remains inactive after installing KMS Pico, the first thing you should do is make sure that your copy of the software is suitable for activation. Next, check that KMS Pico is installed correctly on your device. If all settings are correct, try restarting your computer and running the activation program again. If the problem persists, it is possible that your copy of the software has been blocked by antivirus or security software. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus and repeat the activation process.
### Problem #2: Activation errors when using KMS Pico. How to fix the situation?
There may be cases when KMS Pico generates errors during Windows or Office activation. One of the reasons for such errors may be a violation of the integrity of system files or conflicts with other programs. In this case, it is recommended to use the built-in tools of the operating system to check the integrity of files (for example, the “sfc /scannow” command in the command line). If the problem persists, try temporarily disabling other activation programs or antivirus programs. If this does not help, reinstall the operating system or Office package and try activating again.
### Problem #3: Conflicts with other software. What to do?
KMSPico may cause conflicts with other software, especially other activation tools or antivirus programs. If you have other activation programs installed, try disabling them before running KMSpico. Also, temporarily disable your antivirus software or try adding KMS Pico to the antivirus exception list. If the problem persists, contact a professional specialist who can analyze the specific situation and suggest the most appropriate solution.
